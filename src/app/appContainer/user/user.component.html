  User Component Works!!!
</p>
<p>
  User ID: {{vairable}}
</p>

  This is a simple example of how information from the route can be used by a component. Here, the user component is
  able to get the user id from the route and then use it within functions. In this case, it just is being displayed on
  the page.
